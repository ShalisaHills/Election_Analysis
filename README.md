# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview
The purpose of this assignment was to assist with reporting the election results for a US Congressional presinct in Colorado.  In addition to reporting the results the code will be used to automate election results for future audits.

1. Open the data file.
2. Write down the names of all the candidates.
3. Add a vote count for each candidate.
4. Get the total votes for each candidate.
5. Get the total votes cast for the election.
6. The voter turnout for each county
7. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
8. The county with the highest turnout

**Deliverables**
1. The Election Results Printed to the Command Line
2. The Election Results Saved to a Text File
3. A written Analysis of the Election Audit (README.md)

## Resources
- Data Source: Election_Analysis.csv
- Software: Python 3.8 & VS Code 11.6
## Summary

Below you will find an overview of the campaign results. There were **369,711** votes cast in this election. 

### Candidate Results

1. Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
2. Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
3. Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

**Winner**: Diana DeGette
Winning Vote Count: 272,892
Winning Percentage: 73.8%

### County Results
1. Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
2. Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
3. Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

**Winner**: Denver
Winning Vote Count: 306,055
Winning Percentage: 82.8%

## Challenge Summary
The code used for this audit can be easilty repurposed for other campaign audits. The loops and if statements can be repurposed however the variables may need to be reset for example I added variables for the county data i.e (county_votes).  The logic to iterate throughout the data set was the same I just needed to update the row information or initiate the corresponding variables.  T
